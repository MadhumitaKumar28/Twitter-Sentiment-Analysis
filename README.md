# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Our project, Twitter Sentiment Analysis, looks for linguistic patterns that may indicate sadness by analysing language usage on Twitter as a means of evaluating mental health. With Twitter data mining, we offer data-driven recommendations for mental health awareness and early intervention. We collaborate with stakeholders to uncover mental health indicators, overcoming challenges like data bulk and ethical issues as we methodically collect and analyse data within our one-month timeframe. Sentiment analysis, a deep learning model, and user and content management are all part of the "Detecting Depression on Social Media using Deep Learning" phase, which tackles problems including data volume and moral dilemmas. Public health insights, early action, and community support are among the suggested advantages.
The executive summary describes the solution's deployment strategy, continuing maintenance, user training, and upcoming advancements to emphasise our dedication to employing AI for mental health. Test results show a substantial accuracy, and optimisation strategies focus on pre-processing data and ethical issues. The comprehensive overview addresses objectives, strategies, challenges, outcomes, and future concerns for stakeholders and decision-makers. 
In an effort to raise awareness of mental health issues, our study uses analytical questions to direct our investigation of Twitter data. These inquiries explore topics including model creation, language patterns, and sentiment analysis. In addition to looking for linguistic clues that point to sadness, we also want to comprehend the complex connections that exist between language and mental health. Our goal in answering these analytical questions is to add to the growing conversation on the relationship between language, technology, and mental health.
